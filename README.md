## Layouts

### mimi

This is a layout based on [miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku), without the more advanced features (eg. alternative layers, most tap dance buttons).
It also includes 4 extra keys for the extra keys on the (name tbd).
The goal of essentially forking miryoku is to have a simpler base to start modifications (namely french accented keys and symbols).
